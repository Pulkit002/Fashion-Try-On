# Virtual Fashion Try-on
## Introduction
Our project aims at the transfer of a clothing item from its image onto a reference person, to virtually "try-on" the clothing item onto the person. The challenge here is generating photo-realistic images for simple or complex pose of the reference image of the person.
We plan on achieving this using a Content Generating and Preserving Network. We first predict the semantic layout of the person's image and then determining if the content needs to be preserved or generated based on the predicted semantic layout.
